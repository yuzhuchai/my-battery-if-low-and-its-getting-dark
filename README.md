* This is a poem for the Mars Opportunity Rover. 

* The poem is meant to be read out loud. The work included the clmtrackr to track the change of expressions in the video feedback. A slight change of the expression will cause the text to change rapidly, creating a human glitch when trying to read the poem outloud. 

* the facial tracking function also creates a direct feedback loop between the viewers and the computer - **When you are trying to read the computer, the computer is also trying to read you.**
